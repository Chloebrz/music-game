UV5 Music Game
==============

Description
-----------

This is a music game developed by Telecom Bretagne students in F2B UV506. The goal is to guess the title and the artist of a music before the other players.

This project uses a Node.js web application using Socket.io and a control point (for the connected objects) using the UPnP protocol.


Run the game
------------

In the `WebApp` folder, run :

    npm install

This will install the npm dependencies for the web application.

Then, to run the server of the web application, simply run :

    node server.js

Create a new Eclipse project and add the 2 source files from `ControlPoint`. Add the external libraries found in this archive http://public.enst-bretagne.fr/~irebai/UPnP/Cyberlink/lib/xerces2-9.rar. Run the `MyControlPoint.java`.

Run the upnp-sample-light device from Cybergarage.
